CP3402 Assignment   1
Task:
Design, create and   publish websites for your   own startup   idea   using   two   different   well-known   CMSs.
“A startup is a company   working   to solve a problem   where   the solution is   not   obvious   and success   is   not   guaranteed” says   Neil   Blumenthal, cofounder and co-CEO   of Warby   Parker.
Wikipedia says a startup   is an   entrepreneurial venture   or   a   new   business   designed   to   search   for   a repeatable and scalable   business   model.   It   is   not just a   new   business... So, your   idea   must   have   some   innovative or novel aspect to   it.   Examples of   business   ideas that   are   NOT   startups   include:   online   store, website design company, site for any   brick-and-mortar   store,   restaurant,   gym   …   Those   are   all “tried   and         true”   businesses where the solution   is obvious, and   are therefore   not   suitable   for   your   assignment   topic.
Here are some   lists of startups   if   you   need   some   ideas:
•       AngleList's 52 startups   to   watch   out   for   2020
•       70   best   startups   to   watch   in   2022
Your   idea can   be   new or something you   have   used   before,   and   it   can   be fictitious   or   real,   as   long   as   you   have   not already   made a website for   it   (you cannot   re-use   or   re-make   an   existing   site).
Choice of   CMS:
You   must   use   "proper" self-hosted CMSs   (e.g., WordPress, Joomla,   Drupal, etc.),   NOT   site   builders   or   WYSIWYG systems   like Wix,   Squarespace, Weebly, etc.
You   may   not   use wordpress.com   (which   is   hosted   by wordpress.com   and   is   not something you could   move   to a different   host   if   you   chose).
If your chosen system does   not   have an   export/backup   feature,   then   it   is   not   suitable   for   this   assignment.   You   may   not   use   plugins   (in any CMS) that   replace the core   functionality,   like   nicepage,   Elementor,   etc.
Design:
You will   make the same site   in two different   CMSs.   The   two   sites   should   have   the   same   content   and structure   but do   not   need to   be   identical. They should   look as   similar   as   practical,   but you   do   not   need   to   create custom themes/templates. You can   use any   available   designs/themes,   but they   should   be   appropriate for your goal   and target audience.   As   an   idea   of what   is   meant   by   "similar",   you   should   be   able   to describe the site and   how to   use   it to   anyone   and   they   could   see/use   either   site   with   no   trouble.   E.g.,   if you said,   "click on the   blue About   Us   link at the   top",   that   should   work   for   both   sites.
Content:
Most of the content   is   up to you,   but   it   must   be suitable   and   complete.   You   must   create   the   content   yourself.   Even   if   it's a fictitious   idea, you cannot copy   from   somewhere   else.
Content could   include: details of your   (potentially fictitious)   product   or   service   (like features,   benefits,   pricing, comparisons), contact   information,   privacy/legal statements, etc. Your   site   should   have   a   clear   goal   (with calls-to-action)!
Some content   requirements:
•         You   must   include a short video that you   make for your   startup. This   does   not   need   to   be   fancy   or   take a   long time – you could just   record   it on   a   phone   or   digital   camera that   you   get your   dog   to hold.
•         You   need some   kind of team   page that describes the team   behind   the   startup.   This   team   must   include you as one of the   members   and   you   should   have   your   own   realistic   bio   for   your   goal   career.   That   is, think about   how you   might describe your future   self   (in   5   or   10 years)   and   write   as   if you’ve      achieved that. This   is an   intentional exercise for you to focus   on   your   own   career   goals.
•       You   need to choose,   install,   and   use   at   least   one   additional   plugin/extension   that   is   not   provided   in   a   base   install of each CMS   (these do   not   need   to   be   the   same)   to   provide   some   useful   extra   and   visible functionality to enhance your sites   (e.g.,   map, form,   image gallery,   etc.   but   not   something   ‘invisible’   like security,   backup, statistics, etc.).


Hosting:
The actual sites   must   be   published on a   public   Web   server   (or   servers),   anywhere   you   like.   It   is   up to   you   to   figure out appropriate   hosting. The   subject   resources   page describes several   hosting   options,   all   of which have free/student tiers or credits available. You   must   use   hosting   that   will   still   be   up/visible   for   at   least   6 weeks after submission.   Note that this   means you should   not   use joomla.com   or   similar   “demo”   hosts.
Documentation:
In the   Reflection and   Insights section of a1.html,   describe your   experience   using the   two   different   CMSs   and   hosting   in a   meaningful way.
What have you learned through   this assignment regarding   the different systems?   What h代 写CP3402 Assignment 1
代做程序编程语言as your experience   taught you about the CMSs   as systems?
This should   be thoughtful and to-the-point;   not a   complete   review   of the two   different   systems,   but   your   insights and   lessons   learned.   Don’t just describe differences and   preferences   between   CMSs   -   a   simple comparison   (X was easier than Y)   is   not very   insightful.
Submission:
Complete the template submission file, a1.html, with the   requested   information   including   links to   your   sites   and   plugins   (look for the??   in   the   HTML).
Submit the a1.html file along with appropriate   "exports"   of your   sites   (use   the   CMS's   export/backup   feature)   by   uploading to   LearnJCU   under Assessments.
Submit 3 separate files: a1.html and the   two   export   files   of your   sites.
If   LearnJCU won’tallow your file type,such as xml, then zip   up that   one   file,   not   all   of   them.
Integrity:
The work you submit for this assignment   must   be your   own.   You   are   allowed   to   discuss   the   assignment   with   other students and get assistance from your   peers,   but   you   may   not   do   any   part   of   anyone   else’swork   for them and you   may   not get anyone else   to   do   any   part   of your   work.   Work   that   is   too   similar   to   other websites   (either another student’s work or any   public   site)   will   be   dealt   with   promptly   according   to University   procedures for   handling   plagiarism.   For this assignment,   it   is acceptable to   use free   resources   including themes/templates from appropriate sources,   but you   may   not   use anything   in   away that   infringes   copyright or other   laws   (be careful with   images). You   should   cite the   original   source   in   your   documentation      (a1.html file). You should   write your own   content.
Due:
Submit your assignment   by the date and time   specified   on   LearnJCU.
Submissions   received after this date will   incur   late   penalties as   described   in the   subject   outline.
